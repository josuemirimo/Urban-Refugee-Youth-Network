            <h3>Education & Digital Literacy</h3>
            <p>
              Education is the backbone of opportunity. Our program provides refugee and host youth with essential
              training in digital and financial literacy, English for adults, tailoring, crafts, and hairdressing.
              These skills are not just practical—they open pathways to self-reliance and economic inclusion.
              <br><br>
              We also focus on bridging the digital divide by offering computer literacy workshops that equip young
              people with the knowledge to navigate the modern job market. For many, this is their first chance to
              interact with technology and see new horizons for learning and employment.
              <br><br>
              By investing in education, donors directly contribute to breaking cycles of poverty and dependence,
              ensuring refugee youth become confident contributors to their communities.

            <h3>Child Protection & Support</h3>
            <p>
              Many refugee children face challenges of displacement, trauma, and limited access to care. This program
              ensures that vulnerable children—including orphans and those with disabilities—receive safety, mentorship,
              and opportunities to thrive.
              <br><br>
              Our safe spaces provide psychosocial support and mentorship, while community outreach helps prevent early
              marriages, exploitation, and neglect. We work closely with caregivers and schools to create protective
              environments where children can grow in dignity and hope.
              <br><br>
              Donor support fuels these interventions, giving children access to education, nutrition, and social
              services that restore their sense of childhood and build resilience for the future.

            <h3>Peace & Conflict Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              Conflict undermines community growth. URYN fosters peaceful coexistence through dialogue circles,
              mediation training, and inclusive leadership workshops. These spaces bring together refugee and host youth
              to share perspectives, resolve disputes, and build empathy.
              <br><br>
              By strengthening youth leadership in peacebuilding, we nurture a generation committed to tolerance and
              social cohesion. This program has already reduced tensions in communities and inspired young people to act
              as peace ambassadors.
              <br><br>
              With donor support, we can expand these initiatives to reach more neighborhoods, preventing violence and
              empowering youth as agents of reconciliation.

          <div class="program-content">
            <h3>Socio-economic Development</h3>
            <p>
              Economic stability is vital for refugee youth striving for independence. Our program connects young people
              to vocational training, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship opportunities. We also link youth to
              mentors, employers, and market networks that open real doors for employment.
              <br><br>
              From small business start-ups to school retention support, URYN’s socio-economic interventions help
              families move beyond survival toward sustainable livelihoods.
              <br><br>
              Every donor dollar here translates directly into food security, business capital, or tuition support,
              creating ripple effects that sustain entire families.

          <div class="program-content">
            <h3>Soccer for Social Impact</h3>
            <p>
              Sports transcend language and cultural barriers. Our soccer initiative uses the game to unite refugee and
              host youth, building teamwork, trust, and inclusion. Matches double as platforms for health awareness,
              gender equality campaigns, and life-skills training.
              <br><br>
              Beyond the pitch, soccer fosters friendships that reduce stigma and strengthen community bonds. For many
              young people, it’s also a vital outlet to cope with trauma and stress.
              <br><br>
              Donors help us expand coaching, provide kits, and organize tournaments that inspire youth and build
              healthier, more cohesive communities.

            <h3>Refugee Youth Festival</h3>
            <p>
              Once a year, URYN hosts the Refugee Youth Festival—a celebration of culture, creativity, and enterprise.
              The festival provides a stage for young people to showcase talents in music, dance, art, and business.
              <br><br>
              It also connects refugee entrepreneurs with buyers and partners, turning creativity into opportunity.
              Beyond entertainment, the festival raises awareness about refugee resilience and potential.
              <br><br>
              Donors play a crucial role by funding logistics, mentorship spaces, and platforms that allow refugee youth
              to shine before wider audiences.
